Helena: O spite! O hell! I see that you both want  
To harm me for your amusement:  
If you had some respect and knew your manners,  
You would not cause me this much pain.  
Not only do you hate me, as I know you do,  
But you get together and mock me too?  
If you were actual men, like you pretend to be,  
You would not treat a lady this way;  
You praise and swear and promise your love to me,  
But I am sure that you hate me with your hearts.  
You both competed for Hermia’s love;  
But now you compete to mock me:  
A manly plan, a nice try,  
To make the eyes of a poor lady cry  
With your ridicule! No good person  
Would hurt a virgin so much, and crush  
A poor soul’s patience, all for your amusement.  

**(III.ii.147-163)**

In this scene, Helena is accusing Lysander and Demetrius of mocking her. Lysander and Demetrius have both been affected by a special flower that, upon waking, makes them fall in love with whatever they see first. When they wake up, they both see Helena and fall in love with her. Helena, however, does not take well to this and refuses to believe them, instead saying that they are mocking her.

What goes deeper than Hermia accusing Lysander and Demetrius of mocking her is the situation where somebody loves someone but the other person doesn’t love them back. 400 years ago, almost all marriages were arranged marriages, the bride had no say in the choice of her husband. This means that the groom might love the bride but the bride often did not love the groom. This situation is similar to modern day where a person might love someone but the other person doesn’t love them back.
