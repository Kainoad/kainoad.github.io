Reading Shakespeare is a different experience than reading an average book, the language is such that I find I spend a good deal of time just trying to figure out what he is saying. However, if you can push past the difficult language that he uses, you find that the writing holds an incredible amount of depth to it. Whether it is part of the story, or if itâ€™s just a joke, there is a deeper meaning to almost everything he writes. Reading Shakespeare is hard, but it is interesting nonetheless.
