#### **3 LOVES**

**Love 1: Pokémon**

I have been watching Pokémon ever since I was a little kid I used to have the DVR set up so that it would record the latest episode when it aired so I could watch it later. I remember how excited I was to watch Pokémon when I got home it had the coolest theme song that was stuck in my head for days but I never got sick of it “You can try your best this might be fun, You'll go down in defeat before you've begun….”

I remember when I got a DSi(2008) for my birthday and a super cool game called Pokémon HeartGold. I played that game for hours. it took me a while but I finally conquered the Johto region's eight gyms, beat the Elite Four, and gained access to the Kanto region.

A couple of years ago, my older brother gave me a bag with a GameBoy Color, and an assortment of game cartridges to go with it. I was extremely excited because the GameBoy Color had some of the first Pokémon games to go with it and one of the games in the bag was Pokémon Gold, which was the precursor to Pokémon HeartGold.

I have watched Pokémon for a long time, I have many Pokémon games, and I am always excited for their newest release. I love Pokémon.

**Love 2: Making things**

Ever since I was a kid, I have always loved to take things apart. Whether it was something broken things like an old R/C car, or if it was something that still worked fine like an adding machine, I liked to take it apart and see how it worked. I have taken apart many things over the years and have amassed quite a collection of little bits and pieces and parts of things. When I was still little and had a small box of parts, I started to make things. It started out small, connecting batteries to light bulbs, making motors spin and such. One of the first gadgets that I made was a 9-volt battery taped to a small propellor. You could throw it in the air and it would fall down slowly. The next thing I made was a battery tester. When you put a battery in it would power a little light and you could tell if the battery was good by how bright the light was. As my love for electronics grew, I started to invest more time and money into working with them. I bought little electronics kits, learned how to program, and found projects to work on. One of my current projects is making and programming a temperature controller that will let me heat water to a precise temperature.

I enjoy making things and take great satisfaction in using things that I have made.

**Love 3: Electro Swing**

Electro swing is a modern music genre that combines vintage or modern swing and jazz and qualities from other music genres. It is a modern kind of swing and most examples have a very steady beat and rhythm that is easy to dance to. I was introduced to electro swing about a year ago when my friend showed it to me, and since then I have seen the genre mentioned online numerous times. I love electro swing because it sounds awesome, the beat is very pronounced, and you can find many songs with or without lyrics, which makes it a very good choice for listening to in school because it is not distracting. I love electro swing.

#### **LEGAL TROUBLE**

Intro: We were given a U.S. Supreme Court case and were asked to present to the class and write about it.

**Essential Information**  
Case: Miranda v. Arizona, 1966

Ernesto Arturo Miranda was accused of kidnapping and rape in 1964, and, upon interrogation, a written and signed admission to the crime was collected from him. This admission was used in court to convict him and he was sentenced to 20 to 30 years in prison. However, he was not informed of his rights before the confession was obtained.

**The Trouble**  
The trouble that brought this case to the Supreme Court was that Miranda was not informed of his rights before a confession was obtained. Alvin Moore, Miranda's attorney, objected to entering the confession as evidence at his trial, but he was overruled. Because of the confession, Miranda was convicted and sentenced to 20 to 30 years in prison. Moore appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court but the previous decision was upheld. Miranda requested that his case be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and in 1965, they agreed.
The Supreme Court ruled that, on the grounds of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment, Miranda's rights had been violated, and that it is required that a person be advised of his or her rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendment before a confession is obtained in order for it to be admissible in a court of law. The Arizona Supreme Court's decision on the case was overturned, but Miranda was retried and convicted again without his confessions being introduced.

**Effects of the Case**  
After the Supreme Court's decision, police and other law enforcement were now required to inform their suspect of their “Miranda rights” as they are now called. At this point in time, each state has its own version of the Miranda warning, but this is a typical version:

- You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.  
- Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.  
- You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.  
- If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.  
- If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney.  
- Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?
